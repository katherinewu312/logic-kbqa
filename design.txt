Parsing API:

1. Grammar Representation:

Functionality: Define and manipulate probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs).

Interfaces:
add_rule(rule, probability): Add a production rule, along with its probability, to the PCFG.
remove_rule(rule): Remove a production rule from the PCFG.
get_terminals(): Get the set of terminal symbols in the PCFG.
get_nonterminals(): Get the set of non-terminal symbols in the PCFG.

2. Parsing Functionality:

Functionality: Perform CFG parsing on input sentences.

Interfaces:
cyk_parse(sentence, grammar): Perform CYK parsing on the given sentence using the provided PCFG.
earley_parse(sentence, grammar): Perform Earley parsing on the given sentence using the provided PCFG.
in_out_parse(sentence, grammar): Perform inside-outside algorithm on the given sentence using the provided PCFG.
viterbi_parse(sentence, grammar): Perform Viterbi algorithm on the given sentence using the provided PCFG.
get_parse_trees(): Get the parse trees generated by the parsing algorithm.

Driver Program:
The driver program will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the parsing API. It will allow users to:

1. Define and manipulate CFGs.
2. Input sentences to be parsed.
3. Select parsing algorithms (CYK, Earley, inside-outside, or Viterbi).
4. View the parse trees generated by the chosen parsing algorithm.

Libraries/Tools:
We will leverage the following tools for our solution:

1. Prolog Interpreter: For implementing the parsing algorithms in Prolog.
2. Python Interpreter: For implementing the parsing algorithms in Python. 
This will serve as the "base" program to evaluate how efficient the parsers implemented in Prolog are.
Additionally, the GUI will have to utilize the Python implementations of the parsers.

For the GUI specifically, we will use the following tools:

1. Python Flask: For developing the API endpoints and handling HTTP requests.
2. React: For building a user-friendly web interface for the visualization.

Example Usage:
Here's an example of the parsing API being used in a Python-based driver program:
```
# Import the parsing API module
from parsing_api import Grammar, Parser

# Define a context-free grammar
grammar = Grammar()
grammar.add_rule("S -> NP VP", 0.8)
grammar.add_rule("NP -> Det N", 0.4)
grammar.add_rule("VP -> V NP", 0.1)
grammar.add_rule("Det -> 'the'", 0.1)
grammar.add_rule("N -> 'cat'", 0.2)
grammar.add_rule("N -> 'dog'", 0.2)
grammar.add_rule("V -> 'chased'", 0.1)

# Input sentence to be parsed
sentence = ["the", "cat", "chased", "the", "dog"]

# Perform CYK parsing
parser = Parser(grammar)
parse_tree = parser.cyk_parse(sentence)

# Display the most probable parse tree
print(parse_tree)
```
